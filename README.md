Welcome to ChemPurge!
To get started just download the files from the repository and open the project in your preferred IDE.

This project gathers information from a california database containing recorded instances of harmful substances in products
It uses an unordered map to count the necessary information in the csv and puts the pairs into a vector to sort them from 
most to least number of instances.

Press run and answer the questions that show up on your terminal window.
Results will then appear on your screen.
You may repeat the process as many times as you would like or quit the program if you are satisfied with your search :)
